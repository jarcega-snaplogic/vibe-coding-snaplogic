# MCP Tools for SnapLogic Development

Model Context Protocol (MCP) server integrations for enhanced Claude Code assistance with SnapLogic pipeline development.

## 🎯 Planned MCP Tools

### 1. SnapLogic Validation Server
**Purpose**: Integrate validation tools with Claude Code through MCP protocol

**Functions**:
- `validate_pipeline(file_path)` - Comprehensive pipeline validation
- `get_validation_rules()` - Return current validation rule set
- `suggest_fixes(errors)` - AI-powered error remediation suggestions

### 2. Pipeline Generation Server  
**Purpose**: Generate SnapLogic pipelines from high-level descriptions

**Functions**:
- `generate_pipeline(pattern, config)` - Create pipeline from templates
- `get_patterns()` - List available pipeline patterns
- `customize_pipeline(pipeline, modifications)` - Modify existing pipelines

### 3. Best Practices Analyzer
**Purpose**: Analyze pipelines for performance and maintainability

**Functions**:
- `analyze_performance(pipeline)` - Performance optimization suggestions
- `check_best_practices(pipeline)` - Best practice compliance
- `suggest_improvements(pipeline)` - Architecture recommendations

## 🏗️ Implementation Status

## 📞 Current Status

**🚧 Under Development**

This directory contains planning and architecture documentation for future MCP tool development. The validation infrastructure and pipeline examples are complete and ready for MCP integration.

**Next Steps**:
1. Complete Phase 2 documentation restructure
2. Implement basic MCP validation server
3. Test Claude Code integration
4. Expand to pipeline generation capabilities

**Want to contribute?** The foundation is ready - we need MCP server development expertise to bring these tools to life.
